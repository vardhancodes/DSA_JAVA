What is Recursion?
Definition: Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself repeatedly to perform a task.

Purpose: It helps in solving problems that involve repetitive tasks without writing loops explicitly.

Example: Instead of calling a function multiple times in a loop, the function can call itself to achieve the same result.

Importance: Understanding recursion is essential for advanced topics like dynamic programming, backtracking, and various algorithm implementations.



Function Calls and Stack Memory

Function: A modular block of code designed to perform a specific task.

Function Call: When a function is invoked, it is placed on the stack memory.

Stack Memory: A special area in memory where function calls, local variables, and parameters are stored temporarily.

Execution Flow:

When a function is called, it is pushed onto the stack.

The function executes its code line by line.

If the function calls another function, the new function is pushed onto the stack.

Once a function completes its task, it returns a value (if any) and is popped off the stack.

Control returns to the previous function on the stack.




Key Points About Stack in Recursion

Each function call creates a new stack frame containing:

Local variables

Parameters passed to the function

Return address (where to return after function execution)

Recursive calls keep adding new frames to the stack.

When the base condition is met, functions start returning, and stack frames are popped off.

Proper understanding of stack behavior is crucial to avoid issues like stack overflow in recursion.
